       Walt was once a promising chemist who, in graduate school, contributed research to a Nobel Prize-winning experiment. After graduate school, he co-founded the company Gray Matter Technologies with his friend Elliott Schwartz and his then-girlfriend Gretchen. Walt abruptly left the company and sold his financial interest for $5,000. Gretchen and Elliot later married and made a fortune. Walt resents Elliot and Gretchen for profiting from his work without crediting him.

      Knowing nothing about the drug trade, he enlists the aid of his former student, Jesse Pinkman, to manufacture and, more importantly, sell his meth. Walt's scientific knowledge and dedication to quality lead him to produce crystal meth of unrivaled purity. Walt eventually devised an alternative chemical process utilizing methylamine, giving his product a distinctive blue color. His crystal meth, christened "blue sky" by dealers and users alike, instantly began to dominate the market. While Walt was initially squeamish about the use of violence, he gradually came to see it as a necessity and eventually developed into a ruthless drug lord motivated largely by vanity, ego, and greed. Not only does Walt become more sinister throughout the series, but he rises in power. In Season 1, he and Jesse make thousands of dollars street dealing, but by Season 5, Walt is a millionaire drug lord that supplies crystal meth all across the South-West USA and as far as Eastern Europe. He achieved this by killing Gustavo Fring, establishing his own drug empire and then going into partnership with a neo-Nazi gang.

      After accumulating an $80 million fortune, Walter finally decided to retire from the drug business permanently. However, his brother-law-Hank eventually discovered his criminal secrets and embarked on a mission to bring White down. After aligning himself with Jesse (who betrayed Walt after learning of his poisoning of Brock), Hank nearly succeed in bringing Walt to justice, however he was saved at the last minute by Jack, Todd and their neo-Nazi gang who killed both Hank and Steve Gomez and took Jesse hostage. After being turned on by his entire family, Walt was forced to go into hiding in New Hampshire with the help of Ed and would remain in hiding for months.
